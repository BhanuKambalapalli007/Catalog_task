# Catalog_task

Hi, everyone
First I am here to explain the task what i did and how it will works and what are the apporaches i follows
Kindly this task has 2 ways i choose 
1.using static input format and getting both the test cases in a single output.
2.using creating dynamic input for getting output for the required task using input form for the task
***Problem Statement***
**Tittle:Polynomial Constant Finder**
**Description**
This project implements a simplified version of Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm. It calculates the constant term (c) of a polynomial using a set of roots encoded in JSON format. The polynomial's constant term is derived using Lagrange Interpolation.
 Given an unknown polynomial of degree m:
       f(x) = amxm+am-1xm-1+.........a1x+c
       where
       -->f(x) is a polynomial
       -->m is the degree of the polynomial
       -->am,am-1,..a1,c are coefficients
       --> c is the constant secret term to be found
 The polynomial roots are encoded in a json format.The is task is 
 1.Decode the provided point(x,y) where y is encoded in different bases.
 2.Use Lagrange Interpolation to determine the constant term (c)
